Full Stack JavaScript Course Project: Sign Up Form

## Basic Sign Up Form Project (No JavaScript Yet)

This is a simple **HTML/CSS sign-up form** created as part of a Full Stack JavaScript course project.  
Currently, the form **does not include JavaScript**, so validation is limited to built-in HTML5 features (e.g., `required`, `pattern`, `minlength`). Form submission handling is not implemented yet.

The form includes:
- Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Birth Date (optional), Password, and Confirm Password fields.
- Visual validation feedback using CSS (`:invalid` and `:valid` styles).
- ARIA attributes for basic accessibility (`aria-required`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-hidden`).
